## Background
Moose (*Alces alces*) are a highly valued wildlife species in North America for a variety of cultural and economic reasons ( [Timmermann and Rogers 2005](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55d2/86e83dd7cae6da270c153858b3d1a98d89de.pdf)). Prior to European colonization, moose were used extensively by Indigenous peoples for food, clothing and shelter ( [Moose In British Columbia](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/moose.pdf)). In the last 100 years, moose have become an important, nutritious, staple food of many interior and coastal First Nations communities in BC ( [First Nations Health Authority fact sheet](https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/Traditional_Food_Fact_Sheets.pdf)).

## Relationship to Forestry





Research has shown that forestry activity influences moose density and distribution, both positively and negatively. Forestry cutblocks remove forest canopy, which generally increases the production of deciduous shrub browse on landscapes, which can positively influence moose. Shrub production in forestry cutblocks varies, but appears to peak anywhere from at 5 to 30 years after harvest, and moose appear to use these stand ages the most. Cutblocks less than 5 years old and older than 30 years old (i.e., mid-seral stands), appear to generally be of less forage value to moose and receive less use as foraging habitat. However, older stands, including mature cutblocks, can benefit moose by providing valuable cover habitat. Closed canopy conifer forest stands are important habitat for providing thermal cover in summer and to intercept snow in high snowfall years or areas. 

Forest harvest, when done in moderation and in a way that creates a diversity of forest stand ages and types, can benefit moose. However, the creation of road infrastrucutre to extract timber may negatively affect moose density and distribution overall. Forestry roads can make areas more accessible to moose hunters, increasing hunting mortality, which can limit moose population size. The overall effects of forestry on moose may be negative when roads endure on the landscape and are not actively decommissioned or recovered. 

Moose have an important and complex relationship with forestry development. Based on a review of previous research on the effects of forestry on moose, the relationship is most likely to be positive when:
  - At the scale of a moose home range (i.e., approximately 10 km^2^), forest cutblocks are interspersed with large mature or old forest stands, and cut in a progressive way over a 5 to 10 year period so there is a distribution of cutblock ages 
  - Silvicultural practices on harvested stands allow for growth of some shrubs, particularly along cutblock edges with mature stands   
  - Roads are minimized, blocked, deactivated or restored
  
  
  


 
  

### Roads
- road density in a watershed area, with an ideal target of less than 1km/km^2^   


### Forest Stand Characteristics
  - percentage of watershed area that is 5 to 30 years old, with an ideal percentage of 30%
 - percentage of watershed area that is conifer stands greater than 5 ha in size and 15m tall, with an ideal percentage of 40%

## Current Conditions



### Population Status and Trend
Moose population data was obtained by searching the BC government's [species inventory web explorer (SIWE)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/species-inventory-web-explorer-siwe) for 'moose' inventory data collected in the Skeena region. Any data on moose density, populations, bull:cow ratios and calf:cow ratios was compiled. 


Surveys completed in Nass Wildlife Area (NWA), which overlaps parrs of the western part of Kispiox TSA and WMUs 6-15 and 6-30.

In NWA, decreasing population trend from 2001 to 2011, but increase again between 2011 and 2017 (but not to 2001 peak).

Kispiox Valley survey area overlaps much of the Kipsiox TSA, including  much of wildlife management unit 6-30, and portions of 6-08, 6-09 and 6-15. Surveyed in 1999, 2014 and 2020 (prelimnary results) suggested no popualtion delicne, despite decreasing hutner success rates. Hunter success declien may be due to older cutblocks, adn poorer sightlines for hunters, limiting their success. 


In teh Kispiox area, hunter harvest generally incfreased form the late 1970's (~20 animals) to mid 1990's (~40 animals), but declined from the mid 1990's to 2010 (~15 animals). Hunter effort (moose hunter days/kill) increased from 2005 (~30 days/kill) to 2011 (~80 days/kill). In the Bulkley-Lakes region (southern part of the Kispioc TSA), moose harvest has been declining from the 1980's (~1300 aniamsl) to 2010 (~600 aniamls). Harvest delvinces generall correalted with teh numbe rof resident hunters, suggesting delcin in harvets is due to decline in hunter particaption in moose hunting. Hunter effort is realtivel low and has been mostly below 35 days/kill from teh late 1920's to 2010. Mangament target is 25 to 35 days/kill

The ratio of bull moose to cow moose is often used to indicate hunting pressure on moose populations, and a ratio of greater than 30 bulls to 100 cows is a typical management target, where populations below that indicate a heavily hunted, and potentially unstable population ( [Young and Boertje 2008](https://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/view/37); [Walker et al. 2017](http://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/siwe/download.do?docId=34052)).
